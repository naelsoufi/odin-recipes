Create a website with couple recipes.
An exercise aimed at learning basic html structure, lists, links, images, heading levels and paragraphs.

Nothing I didn't know on the HTML front but fun to experiment with Git as it is completely new to me.
Still hard to know what is considered a small or big enough commit. I think I struck the right balance between the two.

Also fun to learn by heart the html boilerplate. Good practice to have.
